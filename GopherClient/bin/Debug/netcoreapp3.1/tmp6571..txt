!Establish Calm and Control

When an emergency happens
-------------------------
When an emergency happens, having a step-by-step approach to the problems 
facing you can help you think clearly and care for the most important problems 
first. 

 1. Take a deep breath. Emergencies can be scary. But the calmer you are, the 
    more useful you will be. Being calm will also comfort and help the injured 
    person or people around you.
 2. Ask yourself: is this place safe? Move the person and yourself away from 
    fires, busy streets, or other dangers.
    (If the person might have a neck or back injury, move him carefully so you 
    do not move his neck.)
 3. Treat the most dangerous problems first. No matter what caused the injury, 
    check breathing immediately. It is the most important function needed for 
    life. See about difficulty breathing.
 4. After breathing, check for bleeding. Heavy bleeding can kill.

    Protect yourself
    ---------------
    Try to keep blood and body fluids off yourself when caring for people who 
    are bleeding. Avoid touching with bare hands anything soiled by blood.

     * Wash your hands often. Also flush out any blood that gets in your eyes 
       or into a cut in your skin to help prevent you from getting an 
       infection.
     * Cover your skin and eyes. Wear glasses and clean gloves if you can. 
       Plastic bags worn on your hands work too.

 5. When the person is breathing and heavy bleeding is controlled, check the 
    whole body for other injuries and broken bones. Start at the head and 
    check every part of the body, front and back, down to the toes. Gently ask 
    questions, look the person over, and carefully touch the body to see if 
    there are hidden injuries that may be hard to see at first. It is common 
    to have more than one injury.
 6. Try to be as gentle and comforting as you can. Injured people are often 
    scared and in pain. When a person calms down, this helps their 
    fast-beating heart and fast breathing return to normal.

Check breathing often and make sure bleeding is under control. Also check 
blood pressure, if you can. An injured person may seem fine at first and then 
suddenly get worse. Regularly re check these important signs until you are 
sure the person is OK. Keep talking to an injured person. This will help you 
see if they are confused or if their confusion gets worse.

The people who gather after an accident should be encouraged to help. Ask 
loud, assertive people to clear a space around you and the injured person. 
Tell someone to go for medical help and someone else to get supplies like 
cloth (for bandages), or blankets. Giving out tasks will keep people calm and 
help the urgent tasks get done.

The injured person can also help herself. People can put pressure on their own 
wounds to stop bleeding. This can focus the person and allows you to check for 
other injuries or to care for other injured people.
