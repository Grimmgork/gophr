[04] WHERE ARE ALL THE BANNER ADS?

     To us, banner ads and advertising on the NET is a NEW thing.
     I personally (smj) did not want to see the commercialisation
     of the internet.  Its VERY important to me that there are no
     banner ads and that SDF's 'web' presence remain stark and
     minimal.  If you've noticed, I've only used non-text where
     its absolutely necessary.  Once 'links' came around, I
     decided FRAMES were okay.  Then I decided that they weren't
     OKAY again .. ;-)  

     Anyway, enjoy SDF and say NO to commercialism.
